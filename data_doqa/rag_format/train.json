            "How do I stop my brownies from rising?###I have been trying out brownie recipes baked in a muffin tin. I am using the muffin tin so that I can get all edges. (And I have been decorating the tops!) My brownies tend to rise, in my opinion, too much.###This rising is also not quite uniform for all the brownies. Some are flatter than others. The result tastes fine, but is not dense like other brownies.",
            "Well, if air is the only raising agent, simply add less of it by not beating the mixture as much",
            "Other than maybe air that I beat in, there are no rising agents. How do I stop the brownies rising to get denser brownies?",
            "Failing that, beat as normal, then give the mixing bowl a couple of (careful) bangs on the counter top to knock the air out it again",
            "How do I make sure I dont overdo it?",
            "A bit of experimentation will be necessary to get the right results",
            "Is there any other suggestion for me?",
            "I think: perhaps pour some of the mixture into the tin as is, then knock the air out of the remaining mixture and compare the results",
            "That sounds helpful. Appreciate it###any other tips?"

Alton Brown recommends 3 cups of water for ~25 mins and then (1/2 cup of milk + 1/2 cup of buttermilk) for ~10 mins.###However, I would like to do away with water entirely (just curious). Could I just simmer 1 cup of oats in 4 cups of milk for ~40mins?",
            "you can entirely replace water with milk. The main thing to be aware of is how prone it is to boiling over. Milk will eagerly do that on its own",
            "is the first ~25mins of simmering in water designed to maximize water absorption?",
            "the combination has to be cooked on very low heat to avoid making a huge mess. (I think this is why the original recipe starts with water: less time with potential for boiling over",
            "Also, if anyone has cooked oats mostly in milk before, I'd like to hear their opinion as well###Thank you",
            "If you want them to cook faster and have less potential boiling over to worry about, you can always presoak in milk beforehand",
            "That sounds helpful. Thanks for the tip",
            "I've done this overnight in the fridge, which was enough to let me make (admittedly slightly chewy) steel-cut oats in the microwave the next morning",
            "Okay. Anything else that I should know",
            "You'll also probably want to be more careful about stirring the first time; if the heat is a little higher than you realize, you will start accumulating a layer on the bottom of the pan",
            "okay. Thank you!###Appreciate it"
